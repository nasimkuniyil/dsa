# Linked List

A **linked list** is a fundamental data structure in computer science that mainly allows efficient **insertion** and **deletion** operations compared to arrays. Like arrays, it is also used to implement other data structures like stacks, queues, and deques.

## Comparison with Array

### Linked List
* **Data Structure**: Non-contiguous
* **Memory Allocation**: Typically allocated one by one to individual elements
* **Insertion/Deletion**: Efficient
* **Access**: Sequential

***

### Array
* **Data Structure**: Contiguous
* **Memory Allocation**: Typically allocated to the whole array
* **Insertion/Deletion**: Inefficient
* **Access**: Random
