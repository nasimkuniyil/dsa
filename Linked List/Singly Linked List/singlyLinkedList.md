## SINGLY LINKED LIST

A **singly linked list** is a fundamental data structure. It consists of **nodes** where each node contains a **data field** and a **reference** to the next node in the linked list. The reference of the last node is **null**, indicating the end of the list. Linked lists support efficient insertion and deletion operations.

### Node Structure

In a singly linked list, each node consists of two parts: **data** and a **pointer** to the next node. This structure allows nodes to be dynamically linked together, forming a chain-like sequence.

**Example:**

`{data, next} -> {data, next} -> {data, next:null}`
`Head^`
