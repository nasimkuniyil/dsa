## SINGLY LIKED LIST

A singly linked list is a fundamental data structure, it consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a referance to the next node in the linked list. the next of the last node is null, indicating the end of the list. Linked lists support efficient insertion and deletion operations.

Node Structure:
In a singly linked list, each node consists of two parts: data and a pointer to the next node. This structure allows nodes to be dynamically linked together, forming a chain-like sequence.
example:
{data, next} -> {data, next} -> {data, next:null}
